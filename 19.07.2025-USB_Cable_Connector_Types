USB Connector Types

USB Type A

Used with the old USB 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 standards, and it's still supported in USB 3 and above

The Type A connector is the most commonly used on desktops and laptops 

USB Type B

Type B Standard 
Type B Mini
Type B Micro

Type B connectors for USB 3.0 look a little bit different

Type B
USB 2.0 
USB 3.0

Whether using USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 type B connectors is going to come down to the type of device being used

USB 3.0
Doesn't have an equivalent type B mini connector like USB 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 do, but instead uses a type B micro connector

USB Type C

USB Connectors come in various types, each designed for specific devices and purposes

USB Cables

Serial Cables 
Originally connected to computers using DB9 or DB25 connectors

Serial connections could only have one device plugged into one serial port

A USB port can connect up to 127 connected devices in what's known as a daisy chain

127 devices is the theoretical maximum, but, in reality, particular ports will have a limit and it might be much smaller than 127

Host Controller
Uses the same amount of bandwidth for all devices on a particular port

Devices in a particular chain share bandwith

Splitting a USB 1.0 or 2.0 port across multiple devices in a hub can significantly reduce the speed

The longer the cable is, the more resistance that builds up in that cable and the more the speed and the signal is going to deteriorate

These are the maximum specifications that should be supported by a device

25-foot USB 3 cable would not have speeds of 5 Gbps like the 9-foot cable would

USB cables can also be used to provide power for devices

USB 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 
500 milliamps or 0.5 amps

USB 3.0 and 4.0
900 milliamps or 0.9 amps

Powered Device (PD) Port
Dedicated powered port that can give up to 1500 milliamps or 1.5 ampsor 7.5 watts of power
