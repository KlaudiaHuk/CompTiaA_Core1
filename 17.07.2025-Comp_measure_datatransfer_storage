Computers measure data transfer and storage using either bits or bytes

Bit
Refers to a binary digit; A single bit can store only one of two values: 1 or 0

Nibble
Four bits that are combined together

Byte
Contains eight bits

1Kb 
1 000 bits

'b'
Bits

'B'
Bytes (1B = 8b)

Bits (b) 
Kilobits (Kb) = 1000 b 
Megabits (Mb) = 1 million b
Gigabits (Gb) = 1 billion b
Terabits (Tb) = 1 trillion b

Storing data is written in terms of bytes

1000 b / 8 b = 125 B

1 Mb
1 million bits

1 MB
1 million bytes

1 Gbps
1000 Mbps

250 MBps
2000 Mbps = 2 Gbps

Data Storage
